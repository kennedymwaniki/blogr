              Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you
              focus on one thing: creating content. The editor supports
              management of multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of
              embeds such as images, videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with
              plugins and themes provide easy ways to add functionality or
              change the looks of a blog.
