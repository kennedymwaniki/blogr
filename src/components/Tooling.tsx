            Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a large
            community of helpful developers. It supports features such as code
            syntax highlighting, RSS feeds, social media integration,
            third-party commenting tools, and works seamlessly with Google
            Analytics. The architecture is clean and is relatively easy to
            learn.
